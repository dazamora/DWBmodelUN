Description: A tool to hydrologic modelling using the Budyko 
    framework and the Dynamic Water Balance model with Dynamical Dimension
    Search algorithm to calibrate the model and analyze the outputs from
    interactive graphics. It allows to calculate the water availability
    in basins and also some water fluxes represented by
    the structure of the model.
