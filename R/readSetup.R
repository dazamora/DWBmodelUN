#' Read the model setup
#'
#' @description This function reads the setup features of the model. These include the dates that define the simulated time period, and also the variables
#' that will be printed in individual directories. It reads the information from a \emph{\code{RData}} file, and returns the identified variables in a tailored dataframe.
#' Optionally, one can insert the string setup in a dataframe and hence use it in this function.
#'
#' @param Read is a boolean which is used to identify whether the modeller has created its own dataframe in R or
#' the setup is read from file previously written in the \code{data} directory. An example of the file is contained in the package.
#' The default value is \emph{\code{TRUE}}, meaning that it will read the plain file from the \code{data} directory.
#' @param setup is an optinal dataframe that contains the character strings which specifies dates and variables to be printed.
#' The first seven rows must be character strings specifying the actions regarding if the modeller requires to print the
#' simulated variables. The order is: calibration mode, print variables, print total runoff, print soil moisture, print actual ET, print direct runoff,
#' print baseflow. Those strings must be \emph{YES} or \emph{NO}. The next four rows are: the initial date of simulation, the initial date for calibration,
#' the final date of simulation, and the final date of calibration. This dates must be in the format year-month-day. If calibration is not
#' required, those dates are ignored.
#' 
#' @return An organized dataframe which defines the model setups.
