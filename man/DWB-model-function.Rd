\usage{
dwbCalculator(p_v, etp_v, g_v, s_v, alpha1_v, alpha2_v, smax_v, d_v)
}
\arguments{
\item{p_v}{matrix comprised by the precipitation records and that has as raws the number of cells that will be simulated and as columns the number of time steps to be simulated}

\item{etp_v}{matrix comprised by the potential evapotranspiration records and that has as raws the number of cells that will be simulated and as columns the number of time steps to be simulated}

\item{g_v}{vector comprised by the initial values of the ground water storage, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\item{s_v}{vector comprised by the initial values of the soil water storage, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\item{alpha1_v}{vector comprised by the values of the retention efficiency that must be between 0 and 1, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\item{alpha2_v}{vector comprised by the values of the evapotranspiration efficiency that must be between 0 and 1, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\item{smax_v}{vector comprised by the values of the soil water storage capacity that must be above 0, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\item{d_v}{vector comprised by the values of the recession constant that must be between 0 and 1, it must have as many values as cells defined to simulate}

\value{
a list comprised by the time series of the hydrological fluxes calculated by the model. The fluxes are:
the total runoff, the actual evapotranspiration, the groundwater recharge, the surface runoff, the baseflow and
the soil water storage. The time series have the same length as the forcings that where employed to run the model
}
\description{
The function performs the distibuted DWB hydrological model calculations in the defined domain and
time period. It is a model based on the postulates of Budyko, which stated that not only does the actual
evapotrasnpiration depend on potential evapotranspiration, but it is also contrained by water availability
\cite{(Budyko, 1974)}. The monthly Dynamic Water Balance is underpinned in the demand and supply limits demonstrated
by \code{\link{Fu's function}}, postulate that is applied to three variables in order to acquire the values
of the fluxes and state variables on a monthly time step. The named variables affected by \code{\link{Fu's function}} 
are: the available storage capacity (\emph{\code{X}}), the evapotranspiration oportunity (\emph{\code{Y}})
and the actual evapotranspiration (\emph{\code{ET}}). The model is controlled by four parameters: retention
efficiency (\emph{\code{\expression{alpha_1}}}), evapotranspiration efficiency (\emph{\code{\expression{alpha_2}}}),
soil water storage capacity (\emph{\code{\expression{S_max}}}), and a recession parameter in the groundwater
storage that controls the baseflow (\emph{\code{\expression{d}}}).

\details{
\code{dwbCalculator()} only performs one simulation of the distributed hydrological model. The decision to perform
other kind of procedure, such as calibration or assimilation, is entirely on modellers' requirements and necessities.
A complementary function is available in the package to calibrate the model (\code{\link{dds}}), which has proved to
be effective in calibrating models with several GRUs.

To start the model one should set the model features using the (\code{\link{readSetup}}) function, load the precipitation
and evapotranspiration forcings with the (\code{\link{upForcing}}) function, build the GRU and parameter maps with the
(\code{\link{buildGRUmaps}}) function, compare the coordinates of the uploaded datasets (i.e. the forcings and GRU cells),
set the initial conditions of the soil moisture and the groundwater storage, and run the model with \code{dwbCalculator} function.
