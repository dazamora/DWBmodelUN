\title{Fu's function for relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration}
\usage{
funFU(PET, P, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{PET}{is the variable which will be inserted as the numerator in Fu's function. It can be a value or a numeric vector,
in which case it must have the same length as the denominator vector.}

\item{P}{is the variable which will be inserted as the numerator in Fu's function. It can be a value or a numeric vector,
in which case it must have the same length as the numerator vector.}

\item{alpha}{parameter of Fu's model which controls the evapotranspiration efficiency, yet it is named depending
on the variables used as numerator and denominator. It must be a unique value of type double.}
}
\value{
a value or a vector (depending on which kind of data was introduced for numerator and denominator).
}
\description{
It is a model based on the postulates of Budyko, which stated that not only does the actual
evapotranspiration depend on potential evapotranspiration, but it is also constrained by water availability
\cite{(Budyko, 1974)}.

\examples{
PET <- 1000
P <- 2000
alpha <- 0.69  # value used by Zhang et al. (2008)
