\title{Graph for DWB model results}
\usage{
graphDWB(var, tp, main, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{It is a list that contains time series of type "ts" which you want to graph. \cr
For (\emph{tp = 2}), it is recommended to list the simulated runoff series first, followed by the observed.\cr
For (\emph{tp = 3}), it must first contain the observed precipitation series, 
followed by the simulated runoff series and finally the observed runoff. \cr
For (\emph{tp = 4}), it must first contain the observed precipitation series, 
followed by the evapotranspiration series and finally the runoff time series. \cr}

\item{tp}{Variable to choose the type of graph}

\item{main}{Main title for the graph}

\item{...}{Other parameters of the dygraphs package.}
}
\value{
Prints a dynamic graph according to the requirements.
}
\description{
This function dynamically graphs the inputs and results of the DWBmodelUN.
It has three types of graphs: \cr
\itemize{
  \item \emph{tp = 1}: Plots any variable in continuous format.\cr
  \item \emph{tp = 2}): Compares the runoff result of the model, with the observations.\cr
  \item (\emph{tp = 3}): It allows to show a comparison between the observed and simulated runoff, as well as, with a set of precipitation.\cr
  \item (\emph{tp = 4}): It presents a comparison between the a set of precipitation, actual or potential evaporatranspiration and runoff.
